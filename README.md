# Generate C++ representations of boosted decision trees

This project tries to provide a generic functionality to transpile trained BDTs
into minimal, efficient C++ functions to evaluate single vectors of features.

While many frameworks exist to train, evaluate and store BDTs, its often hard
to use the results in a productive manner.
